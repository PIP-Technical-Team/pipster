\title{Welfare share by quantile in micro data}
\usage{
pipmd_welfare_share_at(
  welfare = NULL,
  weight = NULL,
  n = 10,
  popshare = seq(from = 1/n, to = 1, by = 1/n),
  format = c("dt", "list", "atomic")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{welfare}{welfare vector}

\item{weight}{population weight vector}

\item{n}{numeric: number of equi-spaced quantiles}

\item{popshare}{numeric atomic vector: the quantiles to return. Will only be
used if \code{n = NULL}}

\item{format}{character: "dt", "list", "atomic", giving the format of the
output}
}
\value{
list with vector of share of welfare by quantiles
}
\description{
\code{pipmd_welfare_share_at} returns the share of welfare held by the specified
share of the population in the parameter \code{popshare}. Alternatively, you can
select the number of quantiles (10 be default), to estimate the corresponding
share of welfare in each.

\examples{
pipmd_welfare_share_at(welfare = pip_md_s$welfare,
                        weight = pip_md_s$weight)
